This RFC would be a convenient place to do it.\r\n\r\nIt could be polymorphic based on the type of the tag content\r\n- tstr implies PEM encoding\r\n- bstr implies DER encoding\r\n- array means hash of the cert\r\n- URI means reference\r\n\r\nThis could allow the removal of x5t and x5u entirely. They would just be folded in with x5bag and x5chain. Any individual cert in the bag or the chain could be any of the types.\r\n\r\nThis is partly in conflict with my issue #22 \r\n",

There is no need to carry a PEM cert in the message itself.  Having the thumbprint or URI would mean that things will get really sticky fast because the same certificate could be referenced many times by different methods.  That is just confusing.",
